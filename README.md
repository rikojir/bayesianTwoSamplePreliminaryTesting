# bayesianTwoSamplePreliminaryTesting

Provides scripts to replicate all simulations and plots of the paper.

Scripts sim1.R, sim3.R and sim5.R procude the results for the parametric two-sample tests (Student's t-test and JZS-BF Bayesian t-test) displayed in table one.
Scripts sim2.R, sim4.R and sim6.R produce the results for the nonparametric two-sample tests (Mann-Whitney-U and Bayesian nonparametric t-test) displayed in table two.
Scripts sim7.R, sim8.R and sim9.R produce the results for the two-stage procedure, displayed in table three.

To produce the figures, run script plots.R, which already includes the results of simulations one to nine, as these may run from multiple hours to multiple days depending on the machine.
